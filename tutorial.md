# Meteor Tutorial
## Learning Without Training Wheels

There are a lot of meteor tutorials out there, but once you get through them, 
you're left with an application that cna't grow.  It sends too much data around,
it lets anyone access anything, and there is no real organization to expand upon.  

The point of this tutorial is to get you started down the path of writing the basis of a
"real" application the "right way" from the beginning.  

## Install Meteor
Everything you need is right here: http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/quickstart

## Create your project
````bash
> meteor create BlogMaker
````

Creates a subdirectory called BlogMaker with a few files to create a small sample app, and the .meteor 
directory which contains all the information about your project that meteor needs to run it.

## Run the sample project
In the BlogMaker directory, simply type:
````bash
> meteor
````
and wait for it to say
> => App running at: http://localhost:3000/
